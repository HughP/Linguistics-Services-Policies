#Linguistics Services Policies
_Services are an increasing component of today's 21st century economy. Data services are more common and important to social function than ever before. This has impacts on academics doing research in linguistics and also impacts minority language users  and communities of users who care about "their data"._  This should challenge potential service providers to consider the following questions: _What should Linguistic Services Policies look like?_ and _What kinds of things should they cover?_
Founders of new services focusing on linguistics, language, and cultural heritage oriented data interactions and transactions may be aware of data concerns from a legal framework (within a certain country) point of view, but, they may be unfamiliar with data concerns as viewed by the community. While the concerns of minority language using communities may not be well known to businesses familiar with data handling procedures, these practices are often known to linguists working in and with communities of minority language users. An additional layer of complexity is that in many cases service users in minority language communities, may not understand the possible data protection rights available to them, or why they may need additional rights in digital contexts.

###Purpose
The purpose of this document is to create an outline which service providers can use to determine if there are additional concerns which need to be addressed in their public facing policy statements.

#Questions
##What constitutes "their data"?
There are several kinds of data: Transactional, derivative, provided, user data, etc.

##Does the policy address data at rest?
###Legal jurisdiction
What legal jurisdiction can "acquire" access to the data, and can they do it silently? Does the service provider have an annual transparency report?
###Physical security of data storage
##Does the policy address data in transit?
###Encryption
##Does the policy address user transaction data?
##Does the policy address data redundancy?
##Does the policy address privacy and in which contexts?
###EU context
###USA context
###UK context
